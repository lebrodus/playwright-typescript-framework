A production-style end-to-end, API and web test automation framework built with **Playwright** and **TypeScript**. It demonstrates the patterns I use day to day as an SDET: the **Page Object Model**, **custom fixtures**, strongly typed test data, cross-browser execution, and a **CI pipeline** on GitHub Actions.

> All suites run against stable public targets (Playwright TodoMVC, the Playwright docs site, and JSONPlaceholder), so the project is clone-and-run with no secrets or setup.

## Highlights

- **Page Object Model** with a shared `BasePage` and typed, intention-revealing methods.
- **Custom fixtures** that inject ready-to-use page objects, keeping specs declarative.
- **Five layers of coverage**: UI end-to-end, web-UI smoke, REST API (no browser), **accessibility** (axe-core), and **visual regression**.
- **Accessibility testing** with `@axe-core/playwright` against WCAG 2.0/2.1 A & AA, via a shared `makeAxeBuilder` fixture.
- **Visual regression** with Playwright's native snapshot comparison (element-level baselines, tolerance + disabled animations).
- **Test tagging** (`@smoke` / `@regression`) for fast, selective runs locally and in CI.
- **Cross-browser + mobile**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit and an emulated mobile project.
- **CI/CD**: a lint/type-check quality gate, a cross-browser matrix with a manual suite/browser picker, and Allure published to GitHub Pages.
- **Code quality enforced**: ESLint (incl. `no-floating-promises`) + Prettier + a Husky pre-commit hook (lint-staged), plus Dependabot.
- **Allure reporting**: rich, history-aware reports, published live on every push to `main`.
- **Robust by default**: auto-waiting locators, retries on CI, trace/screenshot/video on failure.
- **Strict TypeScript**: `strict`, no unused locals/params, path aliases.

## Reporting

Every run produces three reports:

- **Playwright HTML** - `npm run report`
- **JSON** - `test-results/results.json` (for custom dashboards / CI parsing)
- **Allure (live)** - published to GitHub Pages by CI on every push to `main`, with trend history across runs: **https://lebrodus.github.io/playwright-typescript-framework/**
- **Allure (local)** - rich report with steps, attachments and trends:

```bash
npm test                 # produces allure-results/
npm run allure:serve     # builds and opens the Allure report
```

> Allure report generation uses the Allure CLI, which requires **Java 8+** on the machine generating the report. Test execution itself needs no Java.

## Code Quality & Accessibility

- **Quality gate** - `npm run validate` (type-check + ESLint + Prettier) runs as the first CI job; the browser matrix only starts if it passes.
- **ESLint** - TypeScript rules incl. `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` (catches missing `await` on Playwright calls) and `eslint-plugin-playwright` best-practice rules.
- **Prettier** - single source of truth for formatting; ESLint defers to it via `eslint-config-prettier`.
- **Pre-commit hook** - Husky + lint-staged auto-fix and format staged files, then type-check, before every commit.
- **Accessibility** - `@axe-core/playwright` scans against WCAG 2.0/2.1 A & AA; criticals fail the build, all violations are attached to the report for triage.
- **Dependabot** - weekly npm + GitHub Actions update PRs to keep dependencies current.

## Test Design Notes

- **Locators** prefer user-facing roles and test IDs (`getByRole`, `getByTestId`) over brittle CSS/XPath.
- **Assertions** use Playwright's web-first `expect`, which auto-retries and removes flaky sleeps.
- **Data and pages are separated from specs** so tests read as behaviour, not setup.
- **API tests** validate status codes, response shape (contract) and a negative path.
- **Tags** (`@smoke`, `@regression`) drive selective execution - e.g. `npm run test:smoke` for a fast pre-merge check.
